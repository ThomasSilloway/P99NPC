# P99NPC
Create an NPC for P99 that runs as a regular character

## Installation
Install the requirements.txt in your venv

Run the CMD window as an administrator when executing the script

If executing within pycharm, run pycharm as administrator

This didn't work the first many many times I tried and I'm not actually sure what got it to work

I ended up running this:

runas /user:tcsil "cmd /K python .\\src\\app\\main.py"

Where tcsil is your PC username (Found in C:\Users)

idk, magic, but it works!!

Config contains a setting for the window to detect to activate for EQ.  You can find it by using the list windows command that's commented out
